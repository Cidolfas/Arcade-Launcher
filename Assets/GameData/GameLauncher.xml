    <Description>Play as a radio operator for the army coordinating troop movements from just behind the front lines!</Description>
    <LongDescription>The boys with their guns get too much of the love in the popular conscience! The real heroes of the army are the logistics crews, quartermasters, and supply chain managers. But when we tried to make games about those jobs they sucked, so instead we focused on radio operations crews.</LongDescription>

    <Description>A movie with no gameplay, but since we used black silhouettes on a dim background we figured it still worked.</Description>
    <LongDescription>Everything I know about games I learned from Uncharted, but I liked the look of that Limbo thing. I figured, &quot;Games are easy, why not make one!&quot; so I made a mediocre film with mediocre writing and you can walk forwards. Hey, what&apos;s this &quot;game system&quot; thing people keep emailing me about?</LongDescription>

    <Description>A game about dreams.</Description>
    <LongDescription>Seriously, as of when I&apos;m writing this it comes out the next day and I don&apos;t even have the console required to play it. Standard length on the Xbox exclusivity is what, a year? I think that&apos;s how long Braid and Limbo took, though Bastion was much quicker coming to PC.</LongDescription>
